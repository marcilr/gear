BEERBUG - $250
Keep tabs on your home brew operation even if you're not at home with the
BeerBug.  This WiFi-enabled sensor monitors the specific gravity, temperature,
and alcohol content of your hooch, letting you view real-time data on a
computer via a web browser or through dedicated apps for iOS and Android.  Its
built-in rechargeable battery lasts over 25 days and recharges over a standard
Micro USB connection, so even if your fermenting time runs over, all you need
is a common charger to stay informed until it's done.

Noke bluetooth padlock - $60
When buying a padlock, you've traditionally had two options: buy a key-based
lock and risk losing the key, or buy a combination lock, and hope you can
remember the code.  Both could potentially end with you wielding bolt cutters.
Now, the Noke Bluetooth Padlock gives you a third option.  Powered by Bluetooth
4.0, this smart padlock pairs with your phone, letting you open it simply by
pressing the shackle - it will automatically sense your phone and unlock.  And
should your phone die, you can create a custom access code that has you press
the shackle in a certain pattern to unlock.  It's just one less thing to worry
about.

SPHELAR SOLAR FLASHLIGHT - $150
Anyone can tell you the importance of having a reliable flashlight on hand in
the case of an emergency - unexpected power failure, overdue energy bills,
total eclipse of the sun - but flashlights never seem to be there for you when
you really need them.  Whether it's empty batteries or burnt out bulbs, you can
just never quite count on your typical flashlight.  But the Sphelar Solar
Flashlight isn't your typical flashlight, and we're not just talking about its
gorgeous design.  It sports LED lights and micro-spherical solar cells that
provide up to four hours of battery life.
